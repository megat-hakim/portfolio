  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm an aspiring <strong>Cloud Engineer</strong> with a background in IT Support and Help Desk.
    During my internship at <em>Mesiniaga Berhad</em>, I gained hands-on experience with system troubleshooting,
    user account management, and remote support tools. That experience sparked a strong interest in
    cloud infrastructure, automation, and DevOps practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, I've been actively upskilling in <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Terraform</strong>,
    and <strong>CI/CD tools</strong> like GitHub Actions. I enjoy building scalable, secure cloud
    environments and automating infrastructure deployments using Infrastructure as Code.
